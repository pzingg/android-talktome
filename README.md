TalkToMe
========

This is my naive attempt at a "Hello, World" - type Android App.

The app is meant to accompany the MIT AppInventor 2013 Hour of Code Tutorial.  See the
tutorial video at:

App built using Android Studio for Mac, version 0.3.2.  Download page here:

I'm sure I have a lot to learn, but anyway, here it is.  Have fun, Hour of Coders!
