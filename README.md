This is my naive attempt at a "Hello, World" - type Android App.

The app is meant to accompany the MIT AppInventor 2013 Hour of Code Tutorial.  See the
tutorial videos [on YouTube][appinv-yt] or [on the AppInventor website][appinv-hoc].

This app was built using Android Studio for Mac, version 0.3.2.  Download it from the
[Android Studio website][as].

I'm sure I have a lot to learn, but anyway, here it is.  Have fun, Hour of Coders!
